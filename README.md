## üéä student
"student" is an application that severs "applicant" users of Handle My Admission.

Note: This repository is the TypeScript version of the Old Codebase (https://github.com/admission-portal/ap-student) which is now being deprecated, and will not be maintained further.

## üí• Introduction to Handle My Admission

Handle My Admission is a solution that provides an end-to-end platform for institutions to manage their admission process, as well as acts as a one-stop solution for high school students to manage their college applications.

It started with the idea to provide facilities to only one university, but now it‚Äôs pivoting towards SAAS.


## üí° Why did we build this?

The very first reason was to reduce the costs of the solutions that our university was using. Later, we realized that there is no single SAAS platform for admission, where universities can post their openings and applicants can apply through a single platform, because each university currently has its own portal, making it difficult to track your application as a student when using too many universities and openings.

## ü•Å Features

- Dynamic dashboards.
- Query management system.
- Application management system.
- Up-to-date notifications.
- Notice boards.
- Embedded calendars.
- Different payment modes powered by Razorpay.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local development

That's pretty easy. To ensure that you are able to install everything properly, we would recommend you to have <b>Git</b>, <b>Node</b> and <b>npm or yarn</b> installed.

We will first start with setting up the Local Project Environment:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/admission-portal/student.git
```

```sh
cd student
```
Install all the dependencies. 
```sh
npm install
```
To run the React app locally | start the development server:
```
npm start
```
To Build the production ready web application:

```sh
npm run build
```
To Lint the codebase:
```sh
npm run lint
```

NOTE:
- You need to have the ```UserPoolId``` and ```client id```. Go to AWS > Cognito > Manage pools and users > clients or else contact any of the maintainers.Once you have it, Save that into ```.env```:
- for REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL , go to AWS PORTAL > API GATEWAY > DEPLOYMENTS > STAGES, copy the url from there, or , else, contact the maintainer to get started with it.
- Create an app in razorpay to have the key or else, contact the maintainer(s).

```txt
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=XXXXXXXXXXXX
REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_SCRIPT_END_POINT=XXXXXXXXXXXX

REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_DEV_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXX
REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_PROD_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXX


REACT_APP_COGNITO_POOL_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXX
REACT_APP_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXX
``` 

üìÉ NOTE:

1. You must follow the eslint rules defined in the ```.eslintrc.json``` when creating a pull request. Please ensure that EsLint is up and running before submitting your code for linting. We recommend using an extension to assist you in adhering to lint rules.

Learn more about [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)

2. For a smooth installation, Node version ```16.15.x``` is required.

## Please help me getting started with repository's structure! üôÑ

This React app has three types of components: ```components```, which can be defined as the smallest reusable components being utilized or used by the other two types, ```containers```, which utilizes the first type of components, and ```pages``` components, are nothing but views.

some details about directory structure:

Inside /src:
1. **components**, **containers** and **pages** directories contains components whose sole purpose is to serve UI.

2. **contexts** directory contains the contexts used by the application's various components. Utilizing contexts solves the problem of prop drilling.

3. **routes** directory contains Routes defined via useRoutes Hook.

4. **utils** directory have should contain the utility functions which helps in the main flow.

5. **.env** contains the env variables which is used by the application.
